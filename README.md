# WaterX ChatBot API Integration

The backend for the WaterX chatbot is built using Flask and integrates with multiple components from the Langchain framework to create a robust and scalable conversational AI system. The backend provides a RESTful API that processes user queries and delivers context-aware responses focused on water scarcity issues, such as water-efficient techniques and methods.

**Key Features:**

- Flask-based API: The backend serves as a REST API built with Flask, allowing clients to interact with the chatbot by sending HTTP POST requests to /api/chat. It handles input questions and returns chatbot responses.

- LLM Integration: The chatbot leverages Groq API and the HuggingFace model for language model embeddings. The language model (llama3-8b-8192) ensures responses are generated based on user input and document context.

- Document Retrieval: The system uses PyPDFLoader to load water scarcity-related documents and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for document indexing, allowing efficient retrieval of relevant information. These documents are processed and split into manageable chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

- Custom Prompt Template: A custom prompt template guides the chatbotâ€™s response generation, ensuring it focuses on providing actionable and accurate answers related to water scarcity.

- Environment Variables: API keys and sensitive information are stored in a .env file, including the GROQ_API_KEY, which is loaded using python-dotenv.

**Endpoints**
/api/chat: Accepts a POST request with a question in the body. The chatbot processes the input, retrieves relevant context, and returns a response.

# WaterX Backend

The backend of WaterX uses MongoDB to handle user authentication, fetch social media posts, and manage a community forum.

- User Authentication: Supports user registration, login, and session management via JWT for secure access. User data is securely stored in MongoDB.

- Social Media Integration: Fetches relevant posts from platforms like Twitter using OAuth2, with caching in MongoDB for faster access.

- Community Forum: Enables thread creation, replies, and voting. Forum data is stored in MongoDB, and real-time updates are managed through WebSockets.

**Key Endpoints:**

- POST /api/register: User registration.
- POST /api/login: User login with JWT.
- GET /api/social/posts: Fetches social media posts.
- POST /api/forum/post: Create a forum post.
- GET /api/forum/posts: Retrieve forum threads.

# What does our app offers?

- **Home**: Stay updated with curated social media posts focused on water conservation, innovative techniques, and global water-related issues. Engage with the latest trends and discussions on water sustainability.
